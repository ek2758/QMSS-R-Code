R Code for QMSS Courses

WELCOME! 
This is a R code repository translating STATA code used in the Columbia QMSS courses G4013, G4014, and G4016. If you're looking for R code to execute linear regressions, time series analyses, scatterplots, and survival models, you're in the right place. While there are several ways one can execute tasks in R, I attempt to emphasize code readability over code efficiency, so please keep that in mind. 

Please email me with any questions or comments. 

I'm running RStudio on a Mac. :)
