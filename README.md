R Code for QMSS Courses

WELCOME! 
This is a R code repository translating STATA code used in the Columbia QMSS courses G4013, G4014, and G4016. If you're looking for R code to execute linear regressions, time series analyses, scatterplots, and survival models, you're in the right place. While there are several ways one can execute tasks in R, I attempt to emphasize code readability over code efficiency, so please keep that in mind. Start with the Intro.R file. Each lecture depends on previous lectures, so unless you want to deal with errors, follow along.
 
Please email me with questions or comments after you've done the following:
1. Searched (e.g., Google, Duck Duck Go, etc) for your problem.
2. Searched again.
3. Asked a QMSS colleague.
4. Otherwise, if you see a typo or encounter an irresolvable error, LMK! 

I'm running RStudio on a Mac. :) Good luck!
